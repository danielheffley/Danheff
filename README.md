On my page you will find a selection of different projects I am passionate about relating to databases and data science. More projects are being completed at the moment.

Projects:

Fifa Player Clusters - I use statistical clusters to group FIFA 20 players into novel player categories and then compare the clusters to the real life positions the players play.

Mathematics of Melodies - A look into a mathematical paradox of sorts; how is it possible that so many duplicate melodies exist in such a wide world of music?

Predict Surname Ethnicity With Neural Networks - I use a neural net to classify last names by country of origin.

Predict Surname Ethnicity - Another take on predicting surname origin, but instead with a Random Forrest.

SQLite3 Concerts and Visualization - An example of how one could webscrape concerts and theoretically upload them to an internal concert database.
